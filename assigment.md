News Article Categorization and Analysis
Students will develop an NLP-based system that takes a dataset of news articles
(or any text documents) and performs text preprocessing, feature extraction,
and classification to categorize articles into predefined topics (e.g., politics,
sports, technology, health).
Requirements:
1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
 Use Regular Expressions for cleaning text (removing special characters,
handling punctuation, etc.).
 Implement Text Normalization (lowercasing, stemming, and
lemmatization).
 Apply Edit Distance for typo correction.
2. Feature Engineering
 Implement N-gram models (bigram or trigram) to analyse word
sequences.
 Use TF-IDF or Word2Vec to create vector representations of words.
3. Text Classification
 Implement a Naïve Bayes classifier (or an alternative like ANN,
Decision Trees).
 Train the model using labelled datasets (e.g., Reuters, BBC News).
 Evaluate performance using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.
4. Implementation and Report
 Write Python code using NLTK, Scikit-learn, and SpaCy.
 Generate a project report explaining methodology, dataset, models used,
and evaluation metrics.
Project Deliverables
1. Python code for data preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification.
2. Well-structured report detailing implementation and results.
3. Presentation.
